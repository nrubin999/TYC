    <p class="memberdescription">The Pulpit is an international youth publication that seeks to unite the knowledge, creativity, and literary talent of the world's youth through the world’s oldest common tongue – rhetoric. While it may be Qatar’s first and only online youth publication, The Pulpit is committed to helping aspiring writers find their voice – and providing a greater lectern for armchair veterans of the pen. The Pulpit serves to be a stage for the youth to debate, ideate and innovate new notions – and a nursery to nurture them into concrete ideas.</p>

    <p class="memberdescription">Instruments for Change is a non profit organization founded and led by 6 piano students in the Seattle area. They have been growing and gathering support since their debut concert in June of 2014, where they raised $1100. They have filed and become a non profit, gained the support of Music fest Perugia in Italy, widened our influence online, and planned a few upcoming events. Through our efforts we hope to give back to the incredible music community that has brought us to where we are in our piano experience and help others receive the same opportunity.</p>
