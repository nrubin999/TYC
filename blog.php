    <p class="blogpostpreview">Around the world, pockets of inspired teens are daring to dream big. This past summer four of us had the opportunity to be immersed in one of these pockets at the summer educational program, Yale Young Global Scholars. Many amazing teens that came to the Yale program were doing creative things to change the world and these big dreams inspired us to start an organization to connect these youth to make an even bigger difference. As we gathered in the small library of Jonathan Edwards college at Yale University with a few Macbooks and lots of cookies, we put our heads together to think of ways to connect and apply the concepts we had learned in lectures. YouthCorp was born in the midst of this creative energy.<br><br>
As the summer progressed into autumn, our group met almost daily online and started putting together the bones of our organization, combining our strengths and ideas. Our five founders are from three continents and speak a combined six languages. We are from vastly diverse backgrounds with very different skill sets from technology to art to writing to public speaking, but we all united over our common dreams for a better future. 
 
Our goal is to unite youth around the world with passion for making a difference so we can work together for a more global and connected world. As youth, we are the leaders of tomorrow, and we should start changing the world now. If this sounds like you, join YouthCorp! We invite young adults around the world to join our network at TheYouthCorp.org. It's time to build the future together. Change starts now!</p>
